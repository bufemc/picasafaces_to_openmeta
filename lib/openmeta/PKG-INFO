Description: pythonic file tagging
        ==========================
        
        Simple-to-trivial wrapper for OpenMeta_. Rather than re-implementing OpenMeta
        using, say, Bob Ippolito's excellent xattr_, I decided to do it by wrapping
        the already-functional CLI binary, on advice from those more experienced than
        myself who suggested that the pain in getting OpenMeta working as advertised
        from the direct xattr business was great and terrible.
        
        Warning - this thing does rely on parsing the output of CLI apps, with the
        flakiness and performance troubles that implies. However, it's working
        reliably for me.
        
        Usage
        -----
            
            >>> import openmeta
            >>> open('./test.txt', 'w').close()
            >>> openmeta.set_tags('./test.txt', ['foo', 'bar'])
            >>> openmeta.get_meta('./test.txt')['tags']
            ['foo', 'bar']
            
        TODO
        -----
        
          * more graceful error message when the openmeta CLI binary is not installed
